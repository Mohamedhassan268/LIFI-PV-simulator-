\# Li-Fi + PV Simulator



A comprehensive 7-layer Li-Fi communication system integrated with photovoltaic (PV) power harvesting simulator built in MATLAB/Python \[memory:2].



\## Overview



This simulator models a complete Li-Fi + PV system from transmission to reception, including:

\- Transmitter (TX) with optical modulation

\- Channel propagation

\- Receiver (RX) with TIA dual-path architecture

\- Demodulation

\- BER (Bit Error Rate) analysis

\- PV power harvesting integration



\## Features



\- PAM and OFDM modulation support

\- BER/Q-factor optimization

\- Eye diagram analysis

\- Detailed performance metrics

\- Clean CSV dataset output for ML applications

\- TIA dual-path receiver design
