Scope (what this reference validates)
This document captures the parameter values and experimental results for validating a simulator against the "Sarwar et al." system. The paper focuses on a high-speed (15 Mbps) link using a commercial silicon solar panel and 16-QAM OFDM modulation.

============================================================
1) Key experimental conditions (Hardware & Geometry)
============================================================
Receiver Design
- Solar Panel: Commercial Silicon Solar Panel
- Dimensions: 25 mm x 30 mm (Area = 7.5 cm^2)
- Circuitry: No external power supply (Passive mode). No transimpedance amplifier (TIA) mentioned; signal amplified by external commercial amplifiers (Mini-Circuits ZHL-6A+).
- Filters: 98-MHz Low-pass filter (SLP-100+).

Transmitter
- Source: 3-Watt Blue LED
- Modulation: 16-QAM OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
- Driver: Arbitrary Waveform Generator (Tektronix AWG 70002A) -> Amplifier (ZHL-6A+) -> Bias-Tee (ZFBT-4R2GW+).

Channel / Geometry
- Distance: 2 meters (Air channel)
- Optics: Pair of focusing lenses deployed after the LED and before the solar panel.

============================================================
2) Measured Performance Targets (Headline Numbers)
============================================================
Data Rate & Reliability
- Net Data Rate: 15.03 Mbit/s
- Bit Error Rate (BER): 1.6883 x 10^-3
- Peak-to-Peak Voltage (Vpp): 126.9 mV (at receiver output)

============================================================
3) Figure Targets & System Behaviors
============================================================

FIG. 4 — BER vs. Subcarrier Index
Description: BER performance across the OFDM subcarriers.
- X-axis: Subcarrier Index (frequency bin).
- Y-axis: Bit Error Rate (BER).
- Trend: Higher BER in high-frequency regions (due to bandwidth limitation of the solar panel).
- Validation Goal: Simulator should show a "low-pass" filtering effect where higher subcarriers degrade in SNR/BER.

FIG. 5 — EVM vs. Subcarrier Index
Description: Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) per subcarrier.
- Trend: Mirrors the BER trend; EVM increases with subcarrier index.

FIG. 7 — Constellation Diagram
Description: 16-QAM Constellation.
- Visual Target: 16 distinct clusters.
- Quality: "Well converged" (tight clusters), though likely showing some spreading at outer edges due to the 1.6e-3 BER.

============================================================
4) Validation Notes
============================================================
- Bandwidth: The paper mentions using a 98-MHz LPF, but the solar panel itself likely has a much lower 3dB bandwidth (typically kHz to low MHz). The fact that they achieve 15 Mbps suggests they are using bit-loading or that the "passive" mode (low load resistance) significantly extended the bandwidth.
- Blue LED: Using a Blue LED typically yields higher bandwidth for phosphorescent white LEDs, but here it's a dedicated Blue LED, so the transmitter bandwidth is likely high (MHz range). The bottleneck is the solar panel.
