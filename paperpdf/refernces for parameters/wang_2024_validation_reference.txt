Scope (what this reference validates)
This document captures the parameter values, measurement conditions, figure targets, and analytical models for validating a MIMO / Reconfigurable SLIPT simulator. The paper focuses on a 3x3 Photodetector (PD) matrix that switches between Energy Harvesting (EH) and Information Decoding (ID).

3) Figure Targets & Analytical Models
============================================================

FIG. 3 (c) — OFDM Performance Metrics (SISO, Small PD)
Description: Subcarrier performance plots for the communication link.
- X-axis: Subcarrier Index (1 to 500)
- Y-axes:
  1. Power Loading Factor (normalized power per subcarrier)
  2. Spectral Efficiency (bits/s/Hz)
  3. SNR (dB) — Typical range: 5 dB to ~25 dB
  4. BER per subcarrier
Validation Goal: Simulator should reproduce the SNR profile roll-off due to system bandwidth (approx 1.5 MHz usable BW stated in methods).

FIG. 3 (d) — Constellation Diagram
Description: 64-QAM constellation points.
- Visual Target: Distinct grid of 64 clusters.
- Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) implied by SNR.

FIG. 4 (c) — MIMO/Quadrant Tracking (Drifting Beam)
Description: SNR and BER as a laser beam physically drifts across the PD array (PD1 -> PD2 -> PD3 -> PD4).
- Scenario: Quadrant II active for data.
- Trend:
  - As beam aligns with PD1: SNR peaks, BER minimizes.
  - As beam moves to gap: SNR drops, BER spikes.
  - As beam aligns with PD2: SNR peaks again.
- Validation Goal: Verify spatial crosstalk/handoff modeling. Simulator should show sequential SNR peaks as the "beam spot" coordinates move across the 3x3 grid geometry.

FIG. 5 (f) — Supercapacitor Charging Curve
Description: Voltage vs. Time for a 0.1 F supercapacitor.
- Source: Artificial light (60W lamp at 20 cm).
- Ambient: 14 Lux (Dark room).
- Curve 1 (Single PD Mode): Charges to full in ~32.2 min.
- Curve 2 (No Active PD Mode): Charges to full in ~31.0 min.
- Validation Goal: Simulate the harvesting current (I_harv) and verify charging time T = C * V / I_harv.

Eq. (2) — Switching Circuit Transfer Function
The paper provides an explicit transfer function A(w) for the switching matrix (used to model bandwidth loss):
A(w)_dB = 10*log10[ (w^2 * (Ron*Cds)^2 + 1) ]
          + 20*log10[ Rload / (Rload + Ron) ]
          - 10*log10[ w^2 * ( (Rload/(Rload+Ron))^2 * (Cload + Cd + Cds)^2 ) + 1 ]

Where:
- Ron: Switch on-resistance
- Cds: Drain-source capacitance
- Cd: Drain-ground capacitance
- Rload, Cload: TIA input impedance / PCB parasitics

============================================================
4) Validation Notes / Common Pitfalls
============================================================
- "Large" vs "Small" confusion: The 85.2 Mbps MIMO result is for the SMALL PDs (Cube). The LARGE panel only achieves ~5.3 Mbps. Ensure simulator parameters (Area, Capacitance) match the specific panel being simulated.
- Bandwidth Limit: The system bandwidth is dominated by the PSoC/Switching matrix (approx 1 MHz 3dB BW) rather than the raw PD bandwidth. Simulator must include a low-pass filter pole representing the switch matrix.
- Color: The paper uses "Color-based SLIPT". Red (625-750nm) is preferred for power (high responsivity). Green/Blue are used for data or signaling.
