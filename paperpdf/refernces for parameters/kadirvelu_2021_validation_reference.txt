Scope (what this reference validates)
This document captures the parameter values, measurement conditions, figure targets, and the paper-provided analytical / fitted models used to validate a simulator against Kadirvelu et al. (2021).

============================================================
1) Key experimental conditions reported in the paper
============================================================
Optical link / geometry (frequency-response & BER/harvesting measurements section)
- Distance r: 32.5 cm (0.325 m)
- LED radiated power (for reported results): 9.3 mW
- LED: LUXEON Rebel (LXM5-PD01) red LED with Fraen 9° lens (85% transmittance)
- Solar cell: High-efficiency GaAs solar cell from Alta Devices
- Solar cell area A: 5 cm × 1.8 cm = 9.0 cm^2
- Solar-cell responsivity used for modeling: Rx = 0.457 A/W

Reported headline outcomes (from abstract / results)
- Harvested power: 223 µW at r = 32.5 cm and radiated power = 9.3 mW
- Example BER point: at modulation depth m = 50% and transmission speed 2.5 kbps, BER = 1.008×10^-3

============================================================
2) Solar-cell small-signal parameters used in paper analysis
============================================================
(These are the values used for the analytical frequency-response plots and related discussion.)
- Shunt resistance: Rsh = 138.8 Ω
- Junction capacitance: Cj = 798 nF
- Load resistor (chosen equal to Rmpp in the analysis): Rload = 1.36 kΩ
- Load capacitor: Cload = 10 µF

============================================================
3) Receiver & circuit blocks (paper implementation)
============================================================
Receiver architecture (Fig. 11)
- Current-sense resistor: Rsense = 1 Ω (chosen as a trade-off between bandwidth and harvesting efficiency)
- Instrumentation amplifier: INA322
- Active band-pass filter: 2nd-order, implemented as two cascaded stages
- Comparator: TLV7011
- Op-amps used in filter stages: TLV379 (as used for the filter modeling appendix)

Band-pass filter component values (from the test setup schematic)
- Each stage: R = 33 kΩ, C_lowpass = 482 pF, C_highpass = 64 nF
- Approximate cutoff frequencies implied by these values:
  - High-pass cutoff: fL ≈ 1/(2π·33k·64nF) ≈ 75 Hz
  - Low-pass cutoff:  fH ≈ 1/(2π·33k·482pF) ≈ 10 kHz

End-to-end small-signal frequency response model used in the paper
- Ubp/Umod = Go · Hsense · Hina · Hbp   (paper Eq. (19))

============================================================
4) Figure targets & paper-provided models
============================================================
FIG. 13 — Frequency response (modelled vs measured)
What the paper states to validate
- Frequency response is measured by sweeping the LED-driver modulating input (Vmod) and observing the band-pass output (Vbp).
- The modelled and measured frequency responses agree fairly well, supporting the validity of the analytical model.
Paper model reference
- Ubp/Umod = Go · Hsense · Hina · Hbp  (Eq. (19))

FIG. 14 — Power Spectral Density (PSD) / Noise Performance
Description
- PSD measured at the output of the band-pass filter (AC coupled).
- Measurement Conditions: fsw = 50 kHz, constant illumination.
- Comparison: Measured with filter capacitors vs. without filter capacitors to demonstrate noise rejection.
Quantitative Targets (RMS Noise)
- With filter capacitors: 7.769 mVrms
- Without filter capacitors: 15.892 mVrms
Conclusion
- The filter is effective at removing switching and ambient noise (approx. 50% reduction in RMS noise).

FIG. 15 — DC-DC converter output voltage vs duty cycle (measured)
What the paper states to validate
- Vout is measured vs duty cycle for multiple switching frequencies (fsw = 50 kHz, 100 kHz, 200 kHz).
- Lower fsw results in higher Vout and higher delivered load power.
Additional quantitative targets explicitly stated
- DC-DC conversion efficiency (max delivered / max generated):
  - 67% at fsw = 50 kHz
  - 56.4% at fsw = 100 kHz
  - 42% at fsw = 200 kHz

FIG. 16 — Measured Transient Waveforms
Description
- Oscilloscope capture of the signal chain during data transmission.
- Shows the reconstruction of the digital signal from the modulated light.
Signals Displayed
- Vmod: Modulating input to LED driver (Transmitted signal).
- Vbp: Band-pass filter output (AC coupled, amplified analog signal).
- Vcmp: Comparator output (Recovered digital signal).
Conditions
- Encoding: Manchester code (Logic 1 = Low-to-High; Logic 0 = High-to-Low).
- Data Pattern: Pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS).
- Modulation Depth: 33% (Bit amplitude stated as 40 mV).
Validation Goal
- Verify that Vcmp correctly follows the transitions in Vmod (checking for bit flips or timing errors).

FIG. 17 — BER vs modulation depth (measured)
Panels
- (a) Tbit = 100 µs (10 kbps)
- (b) Tbit = 400 µs (2.5 kbps)
What the paper states to validate
- BER is reduced as fsw increases, attributed to the band-pass filter’s action on switching noise.
Explicit example operating points stated in text
- For Tbit = 100 µs, fsw = 200 kHz, m = 33%: BER = 5.066×10^-2
- For Tbit = 400 µs, same conditions: BER = 3.445×10^-3
- For Tbit = 400 µs and m = 50%: BER = 1.008×10^-3

FIG. 18 — DC-DC Vout vs modulation depth (measured)
What the paper states to validate
- As modulation depth increases, the average transmitted optical power decreases, and the DC-DC average output voltage decreases.
- Increasing fsw also reduces Vout (consistent with the efficiency trend in Fig. 15).

FIG. 19 — Max harvested power vs bit rate (measured trade-off)
What the paper states to validate
- Trade-off curve built by measuring Pout,max while varying fsw from 10 kHz to 300 kHz.
- The paper provides a fitted model (Eq. (20)):
  Pout,max = p1·(log10(bit_rate))^2 + p2·log10(bit_rate) + p3
  with:
  - p1 = 7.972×10^-5
  - p2 = 5.171×10^-4
  - p3 = 5.826×10^-4
  Notes:
  - Pout,max is in watts (W) in this equation.
  - bit_rate is in bps for the log10() term (as written in the paper).

============================================================
5) Validation notes (common mismatches to fix)
============================================================
- Venue mismatch: this paper is in IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking (not IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics).
- Units mismatch to avoid:
  - Rsh is 138.8 Ω (not 138.8 kΩ).
  - Cj is 798 nF (not 798 pF).
