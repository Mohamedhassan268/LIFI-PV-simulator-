Scope (what this reference validates)
This document captures the parameter values and experimental results for validating a simulator against the "Gonzalez-Uriarte et al." system. The paper focuses on a low-cost, off-the-shelf implementation using a generic 5V/40mA PV panel and a microcontroller-based OOK transmitter, achieving 4.8 kBd.

============================================================
1) Key experimental conditions (Hardware & Geometry)
============================================================
Receiver Design
- Solar Panel: "Generic 5V 40mA solar panel" (Small size, low cost).
- Load Resistor: 220 Ω (Chosen to extend bandwidth to ~50 kHz).
- Bandwidth-Enhancement Trade-off:
  - Open circuit (High Z): Bandwidth ≈ 500 Hz.
  - 10 kΩ load: Bandwidth ≈ 1 kHz.
  - 220 Ω load: Bandwidth ≈ 50 kHz (Selected operating point).
  - 11.6 Ω load: Bandwidth ≈ 300 kHz (but signal voltage becomes too low).
- Filter: Twin-T Notch filter tuned to 100 Hz (to remove AC flicker from room lights).
- Amplifier: Non-inverting amplifier followed by a Data Slicer.

Transmitter
- Source: White LED (generic 3W-5W range inferred from context).
- Controller: ESP8266 (WeMos D1 Mini).
- Modulation: On-Off Keying (OOK) - specifically UART serial data.

Channel / Geometry
- Distance: 60 cm (0.6 m).
- Environment: Indoor office with artificial lighting (100 Hz flicker present).
- Line of Sight (LOS): Yes.

============================================================
2) Measured Performance Targets (Headline Numbers)
============================================================
Data Rate
- Max Baud Rate: 4.8 kBd (4800 bps)
- At 9.6 kBd: BER becomes > 0 (Errors appear).

Bandwidth vs. Load (Fig. 2)
- 1 MΩ: BW ~ 500 Hz
- 100 kΩ: BW ~ 500 Hz
- 10 kΩ: BW ~ 1 kHz
- 1 kΩ: BW ~ 10 kHz
- 100 Ω: BW > 100 kHz (extrapolated from curve).
- Validation Goal: Simulator must reproduce this "Load Resistance vs. Bandwidth" curve, showing the pole shift as R_load decreases (lowering the RC time constant).

Voltage vs. Load (Fig. 3)
- Validation Goal: As R_load decreases to increase bandwidth, the V_pp (signal amplitude) must drop linearly or per the divider rule. The simulator must show this trade-off (Gain vs. Bandwidth).

============================================================
3) Figure Targets & System Behaviors
============================================================

FIG. 7 — Oscilloscope Trace (Transmitter vs Receiver)
Description: Comparison of the Tx signal (yellow) and Rx signal (blue) after processing.
- Waveform: Square wave (UART bytes).
- Quality: Sharp transitions at Rx, indicating the 220 Ω load + Data Slicer successfully reconstructed the edges.
- Delay: Some propagation/processing delay visible.

System Block Diagram (Fig. 5)
- Chain: PV Panel -> 220Ω Load -> Notch Filter (100Hz) -> Non-Inv Amp -> Data Slicer -> MCU.
- Validation Goal: Simulator should implement a "Notch Filter" block at 100 Hz and show that it removes 100 Hz interference while passing the 4.8 kHz data signal.

============================================================
4) Validation Notes
============================================================
- 100 Hz Flicker: A key specific validation point for this paper is the *rejection* of 100 Hz noise. If your simulator models ambient light flicker, this paper validates the notch filter's ability to clean it up.
- Low-Cost Focus: Unlike the other papers using high-end GaAs cells or commercial optical tables, this uses <$5 parts. Parameters (Responsivity, Capacitance) should be set to "Generic Silicon" defaults if not specified (e.g., Cj ~ hundreds of nF, Rsh ~ low kΩ).
