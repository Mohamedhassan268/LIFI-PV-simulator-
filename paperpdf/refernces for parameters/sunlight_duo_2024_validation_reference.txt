Scope (what this reference validates)
This document captures the parameter values, measurement conditions, figure targets, and system behaviors for validating a simulator against the "Sunlight-Duo" system. The paper focuses on using sunlight (modulated by an LC shutter or sunlight collector) as the *sole* source for both energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID), without artificial LED/Laser transmitters.

- Number of Cells: 16 cells total
- Configurations Tested:
  - 2s-8p (2 series, 8 parallel groups) - "Parallel-heavy"
  - 4s-4p (4 series, 4 parallel groups) - "Mixed"

Light Sources / Interference
- "Controlled" Setup: LED array (100 W) acts as sunlight interference; Flashlight acts as signal.
- "Outdoor" Setup: Himawari sunlight collector (fiber optic output) + Real sunlight.
- Interference Levels: 3 klux to 50 klux tested.

============================================================
2) Measured Performance Targets (Headline Numbers)
============================================================
Link Performance (Outdoor, 11m Range)
- Downlink Data Rate: 1200 bps (Max stable), 400 bps (Standard)
- Uplink Data Rate: 800 bps (Max stable)
- Packet Success Rate (PSR): >90% at 11m (with collimating lens)

- Supercap Voltage: Maintains > 1.8V (operational threshold) throughout the day.

============================================================
3) Figure Targets & System Behaviors
============================================================

FIG. 5 — Pre-charging Stage Performance (Pareto Frontier)
Description: Charging speed vs. Communication signal strength (normalized).
- Conditions: Supercap voltage < 1.8V (MPPT not active).
- Trend:
  - Parallel (2s-8p): Best for communication signal strength.
  - Mixed (4s-4p): Best compromise for charging at medium light (10 klux).
- Validation Goal: Simulator should show that no single configuration is optimal for all light levels in passive mode.

FIG. 6 — Charging Stage Performance (MPPT Active)
Description: Effect of MPPT operating point (eta_voc) on Communication vs. Charging.
- Parameter: eta_voc (Ratio of V_operate to Open Circuit Voltage).
- Curves:
  - eta_voc = 80%: High charging efficiency (~100%), Low communication efficiency (<40%).
  - eta_voc = 10%: Low charging efficiency, High communication efficiency.
- Pareto Frontier (Fig. 6e): The "Series" connection (8s-2p) with varying eta_voc covers the optimal trade-off curve.
- Validation Goal: Verify that deviating from MPP (eta_voc=80%) to lower voltages (eta_voc=50% or 30%) improves signal detection magnitude at the cost of harvested power.

FIG. 9 — Comparison with State-of-the-Art (SoA)
Description: Supercap voltage and BER under strong light (50 klux).
- SoA approach (switching 2s-8p/8s-2p at eta=80%): Fails (Voltage drops to 1V, BER > 40%).
- Sunlight-Duo approach (8s-2p fixed, dynamic eta): Succeeds (Voltage ~4V, BER near 0%).
- Validation Goal: Demonstrate that standard MPPT algorithms (fixed at 80% Voc) kill the communication signal in high interference.

FIG. 12 (b) — Packet Success Rate vs. Distance (with Lens)
Description: PSR for Downlink (DL) and Uplink (UL).
- X-axis: Distance (m) up to 11m.
- Y-axis: Packet Success Rate (%).
- Data Rate: 400 bps.
- Target: Both DL and UL stay > 90% PSR up to 11m.

FIG. 13 — Link Stability over Time
Description: 30-minute window of packet success rate under variable clouds.
- Conditions: Light varying 10-18 klux.
- Target: Link remains stable (Green/Yellow zones) except during total sun blockage.

============================================================
4) Validation Notes / Common Pitfalls
============================================================
- Dual-Purpose Conflict: The core physics to simulate is that *maximizing power* (operating at MPP) *minimizes* the AC signal amplitude (communication quality) because the IV curve is flat near MPP. The simulator must capture this trade-off.
- Modulation Frequencies: The system uses BFSK (1.6/2.0 kHz). Simulator must handle these specific frequencies, not just OOK.
- LC Response Time: The liquid crystal imposes a ~3ms slew rate. Simulator must model this low-pass filtering effect on the transmitted waveform.
